package org.example;

// You need to design an application that allows the possibility to calculate the surface and perimeter for
// multiple types of shape: rectangle, square, circle and triangle.
// The tool should allow the possibility to add multiple shapes and calculate the total sum for perimeter and for surface.
// Also, the application should make sure that 2 similar shapes couldnâ€™t be added to the drawing tool. In case 2 similar
// shapes are added, an appropriate message should be printed to console.
// Since you want to be sure that you provide a high quality implementation, unit tests are needed to prove the
// main functionalities described above, work correctly (add all types of shapes, add duplicates, add single
// shape and pairs of shapes).
// To deliver the work, just make a zip file and attached it to the answer.
